If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revisit the hardware aspect of the project to make sure that we are creating the correct system for the needs and demand of the software and it 
be able to sustain itself for a decent lifespan.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
As i read the transcript i started taking notes on the ideas of the owners vision from there i expanded out ideas that could take care of the needs of the design.
Software should always be designed to be user friendly and be able to accomidate the most basic user to the most advanced.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Software was based off of the break down of the vision and than designed into sections for each need.
